Yo,

I'm Mahdi Dibaiee, a programmer.

I like hunting bugs in the wild (aka open-source). I study algorithms, data-structures, design patterns, anything I find useful, trying to expand my knowledge.

I train [code katas](http://codewars.com/users/mdibaiee) almost everyday to sharpen my skills and I'm a member of the [Mozillians clan](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Mahdi/).

I also love Parkour and Music.
