Yo,

I'm Mahdi Dibaiee, a programmer.

I like hunting bugs in the wild (aka open-source). I study algorithms, data-structures, design patterns, anything I find useful, trying to expand my knowledge. I'm a [Mozillian](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Mahdi).

I love Open-source, Music, Nature and Parkour.
