An open-source blog, about programming, life and travel, might as well expand to other stuff, too.

Want to write on the blog? open a pull-request.

Authors are anonymous, you are not credited for the posts on the blog (there is no indication of the author of the post).

There is no clear rule of what gets accepted and what gets rejected, if you get rejected, there will most probably
be an explanation of why, if it's not something very off-topic, and if value is found in the content, you will most likely
be accepted. We don't want to dictate anything, we just want to keep things tidy.
